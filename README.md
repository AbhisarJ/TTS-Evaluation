# Objective Evaluation for TTS models
This repository provides a step-by-step implementation for computing relevant and useful metrics to evaluate inference audios from different TTS models. The research focuses on evaluating three key factors that define the quality of TTS models: Consistency, Emotional Richness, and Naturalness. These factors are scored on a scale of 0 to 5.

## Features
1. F0 Contour Visualization: Functions to display and compare the f0 (fundamental frequency) contours of TTS models.


2. Dataset Preparation: Tools to prepare a dataset from a local repository and compute evaluation metrics.


3. Score Calculation: Once the dataset is prepared, the repository computes scores based on the three primary evaluation factors.

## Installation
